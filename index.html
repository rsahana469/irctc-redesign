      <h2 class="section-title">Why this project?</h2>
      
          <p>
              I’ve barely used IRCTC myself, and I don’t have much prior knowledge about how train
              booking works in detail. That became the reason I wanted to redesign it. I was curious
              to understand how a dense government product feels to someone new and what it would
              take to simplify the experience without removing important functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
              I saw this as an opportunity to practise analysing an unfamiliar domain, breaking down
              a complex interface and rethinking the experience with a beginner-friendly perspective.
              Most of my understanding came from secondary research: watching walkthrough videos,
              reading app store reviews, exploring existing screens and speaking with frequent
              travellers about where they feel stuck.

      <h2 class="section-title-small">What I focused on in this redesign</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding user pain points from an outsider’s point of view</li>
        <li>Analysing navigation, hierarchy and information overload</li>
        <li>Restructuring the home screen around booking trains</li>
        <li>Wireframing cleaner flows before hi-fi screens</li>

  <p>
    To understand the landscape and what IRCTC could learn from other apps, I compared it with two popular third-party train booking apps 
    to identify key differences and opportunities.</p>

  <div class="two-column">
    <div>
      <h3 class="subheading">IRCTC (official)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Powerful, official service with full feature set (bookings, PNR, trains, transactions).</li>
        <li>Feels dated and information-dense; navigation often feels desktop-first.</li>
        <li>Refunds and some utilities are slow/complex (higher user friction in edge cases).</li>
        <li>Strong trust factor because it is the government-backed app — important to preserve.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="subheading">ConfirmTkt (third-party)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>More modern UI patterns and clearer flows for booking and refunds.</li>
        <li>Helpful features like waiting-list prediction and quicker refund summaries.</li>
        <li>Tends to prioritise convenience and fast decision-making (good for inspiration).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="subheading">TrainMan (third-party)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong utility features: PNR status, live tracking, quick notifications.</li>
        <li>Simple, focused screens for the most common tasks (booking, status, tracking).</li>
        <li>Good example of presenting dense information in smaller, digestible chunks.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="subheading">Design takeaways</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep IRCTC’s trust signals but simplify the visual hierarchy so tasks are obvious.</li>
        <li>Borrow quick, helpful features (e.g., waiting-list cues, clear refund summaries) without adding clutter.</li>
        <li>Group utilities so they don’t compete visually with the main booking flow.</li>
        <li>Prioritise first-time user clarity — reduce overwhelming choices upon first view.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="highlight-card" style="margin-top:12px;">
        <strong>Why this matters</strong>
        <p style="margin-top:6px; font-size:13px; color:var(--text-muted);">
          The redesign aims to bridge IRCTC’s official strength with the usability lessons from third-party apps: trusted, but easier to use.

        <p>
          Approaching IRCTC Rail Connect as a relatively new user, the experience often felt
          overwhelming and harder than it needed to be. From walkthroughs, reviews and
          conversations with frequent travellers, these issues surfaced repeatedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          IRCTC Rail Connect supports a lot of features, but the way they are presented
          makes the core journey of booking and managing train travel harder than it
          needs to be. From my walkthrough, these issues stood out the most:

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong >Core task is hidden behind an extra step.</strong>
                The main reason people open the app is to book a train ticket, but that
                action is tucked under a generic “Train” option instead of being surfaced
                directly on the home screen.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Flights and buses are over-emphasised.</strong>
                Flights and buses are secondary use cases, yet they visually compete with
                train booking instead of being treated as supporting options.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ads grab attention before ticket booking.</strong>
                A promotional banner appears before any ticket-booking option, pulling focus
                away from the primary task and disrupting the flow.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Too many top-level options before scrolling.</strong>
                There are 13+ tappable options visible before scrolling. Items like YouTube
                or Gift Card feel irrelevant in that moment and add to cognitive overload.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Order food is mixed with unrelated categories.</strong>
                “Order food in train” sits alongside flights and buses, even though it
                naturally belongs with train-related utilities and services.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bills &amp; Shop feels out of place.</strong>
                The Bills &amp; Shop section feels like a separate mini-app inside IRCTC,
                with little connection to the core journey of planning and managing train travel.

              <li>New or low-tech users feel overwhelmed and unsure of the flow.</li>
              <li>Routine actions like booking, checking PNR or live status feel heavier than they should.</li>
              <li>
                The app feels functional but not very focused on helping users complete
                their main task quickly.

              <li>Reduce cognitive load by grouping and reordering content.</li>

                Modernise the UI without losing the “official, trustworthy” feeling of a

              <li>

              This is a concept redesign focused on improving the core experience, not
              rebuilding every IRCTC feature. I focused on:
            </p>

              <li>Home screen (dashboard &amp; primary actions)</li>

              <li>Bottom navigation &amp; utilities (chips on Train screen)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              All back-end logic, rules and policies from IRCTC stay the same. The
              redesign focuses only on UX and UI.

        <p>
          Before committing to any visual style, I explored low-fidelity layouts for the

          flow clearly while still keeping secondary services discoverable.

                Redesigning a government app is more about trust and clarity than flashy visuals.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sometimes a redesign is a bridge – you don’t have to solve everything at once
                to make the experience noticeably better.
              </li>
              <li>
                Writing the case study while designing forces more intentional decisions
                instead of “aesthetic” ones.
